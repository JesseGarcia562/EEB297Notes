This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). I used this package to learn more about web site creation and Github Pages. It serves as a study guide I created for EEB 297: Population Genomics of Structural Variation. The website link is: https://jessegarcia562.github.io/EEB297Notes/
